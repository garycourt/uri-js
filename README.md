# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).

## Loading

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/uri.min.js"></script>
	
To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, simply use:

	var URI = require("./uri-js");

## API

### Parsing & Validating

	var components = URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  errors : [],
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme`
	
	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference`
	
	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.
	
*	`tolerant`
	
	If set to `true`, the parser will not report invalid URIs. It will also relax URI resolving rules.

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. For example, here is the code for HTTP scheme normalization:

	URI.SCHEMES["http"] = {
		serialize : function (components, options) {
			//normalize the default port
			if (components.port === 80) {
				components.port = undefined;
			}
			//normalize the empty path
			if (!components.path) {
				components.path = "/";
			}
			
			return components;
		}
	};

Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]
